   * @copydoc RTC_I2C::setOffset()
   * This RTC has only one calibrated correction mode - an aging offset that is added to or subtracted from the
   * capacitance for temperature correction. This is called the fine offset. If `OffsetMode::COARSE_OFFSET` is used, the
   * input is interpreted as a calibrated offset in 0.01 ppm steps.
   *
   * After having changed the offset value, a conversion is triggered so that changes are immediately visible.
   *
   * Negative values make the clock faster by roughly 0.1 ppm/LSB; positive values make it slower.
